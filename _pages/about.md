I am presently working as a Research Scientist at A\*STAR, Singapore. I obtained my PhD in Computer Science from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore where my work (nominated for the outstanding PhD thesis award) focused on studying the functional architecture of the human brain. At NTU, I was the TA for the Neural Networks and Deep Learning course for UG and the Computational Biology course for PG students. 

Broadly, my research focuses on using computer science to study the functional and structural aspects of the brain. Specifically, I develop methods to study the brain in different states, viz. resting, during task performance and neuropsychiatric diseases. I obtained a B. Eng. in Computer Science from Punjab Engineering College (PEC), India where the institute awarded me with the Institute Color for research activities during my UG. I have worked with researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (US), IASI-CNR, Rome (Italy), Carnegie Mellon University (US), Ben Gurion University of the Negev (Israel) and Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar (India).
